Certainly! Here are the **steps to create a Private Endpoint (PE)** and **Private DNS Zones** for Azure PostgreSQL Flexible Servers, including the setup of DNS resolution for cross-region access.

### **Steps to Create a Private Endpoint (PE) for Azure PostgreSQL Flexible Server**

#### **Step 1: Create PostgreSQL Flexible Servers in Both Regions**
Before setting up Private Endpoints, ensure that your **Azure PostgreSQL Flexible Servers** are already created in the desired regions (e.g., **East US 2** and **West US 2**). These servers should be deployed in **VNets**.

#### **Step 2: Create Private Endpoint for PostgreSQL Flexible Server in East US 2**
1. **Navigate to PostgreSQL Flexible Server**:
   - Go to the **Azure portal** and search for **Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server**.
   - Choose the **PostgreSQL server** you created in **East US 2**.

2. **Add Private Endpoint**:
   - In the **PostgreSQL Flexible Server Overview** page, scroll down to the **Settings** section and select **Private endpoint connections**.
   - Click on **+ Private endpoint** to create a new private endpoint.

3. **Fill in the Private Endpoint Information**:
   - **Name**: Give a name to the private endpoint (e.g., `pe-eastus2-postgresql`).
   - **Region**: Select the same region (**East US 2**).
   - **Resource**: The default resource should already be selected (your PostgreSQL server).
   - **Virtual Network**: Choose the **VNet** that your PostgreSQL server resides in (it should be in **East US 2**).
   - **Subnet**: Select the subnet that will hold the Private Endpoint. If you don’t have a specific subnet, create a new one.

4. **DNS Configuration**:
   - Under the **DNS** settings, select **Private DNS zone**. Azure will automatically create a new **Private DNS zone** and link it to the VNet for DNS resolution.

5. **Review and Create**:
   - Review the settings and click **Create**.

This process creates a **Private Endpoint** for the **East US 2** PostgreSQL server, providing a private IP address within the selected subnet.

#### **Step 3: Create Private Endpoint for PostgreSQL Flexible Server in West US 2**
Follow the same steps as above, but for your **PostgreSQL server in West US 2**:
1. Navigate to your PostgreSQL Flexible Server in **West US 2**.
2. Under **Private endpoint connections**, click **+ Private endpoint**.
3. Select the **VNet** in **West US 2**, choose the appropriate subnet, and enable **Private DNS**.

After creating the private endpoint, you'll have private IPs for both PostgreSQL servers in their respective regions.

### **Steps to Create and Configure Private DNS Zone**

To ensure proper DNS resolution, you need a **Private DNS Zone** that will be used by both PostgreSQL servers to resolve each other’s private IP addresses.

#### **Step 1: Create a Private DNS Zone**
1. **Navigate to Private DNS Zones**:
   - In the **Azure portal**, search for and select **Private DNS zones**.
   
2. **Create Private DNS Zone**:
   - Click **+ Create**.
   - **Subscription**: Choose the appropriate subscription.
   - **Resource Group**: Select an existing resource group or create a new one.
   - **DNS Zone Name**: Use a name that will be used for your PostgreSQL servers. Typically, for Azure services, it would be in the format:
     ```
     privatelink.postgres.database.azure.com
     ```
     This is the standard DNS suffix for Azure PostgreSQL services.

   - Click **Review + Create**, and then **Create**.

#### **Step 2: Link Private DNS Zone to VNets**
Now, link the Private DNS Zone to both VNets (East US 2 and West US 2) to ensure that both regions can resolve the PostgreSQL server's private IPs via DNS.

1. **Link DNS Zone to VNet**:
   - In the **Private DNS Zone** you just created, go to **Virtual Network Links** under **Settings**.
   - Click **+ Add**.
   - Choose the **VNet** in **East US 2** and enable **Auto-registration** (this will automatically register the private endpoint IPs for services in this VNet).
   - Click **OK**.

2. **Repeat for West US 2 VNet**:
   - Similarly, link the **Private DNS Zone** to the **VNet** in **West US 2**.

#### **Step 3: Configure DNS Resolution for Cross-Region Access**
Once you have linked the DNS zone to both VNets, the **private endpoints** for the PostgreSQL servers will be accessible via DNS across both regions.

- The **DNS names** for PostgreSQL flexible servers in both regions will follow this pattern:
  ```
  <your-server-name>.privatelink.postgres.database.azure.com
  ```
  This ensures that when the PostgreSQL server in **East US 2** tries to connect to the server in **West US 2** (or vice versa), it will resolve to the correct private IP via DNS.

#### **Step 4: Verify DNS Resolution**
You can verify that the DNS resolution is working by using the **nslookup** tool from a virtual machine in either VNet.

1. **From a VM in East US 2 VNet**:
   ```bash
   nslookup <your-postgresql-server-name>.privatelink.postgres.database.azure.com
   ```

2. **From a VM in West US 2 VNet**:
   ```bash
   nslookup <your-postgresql-server-name>.privatelink.postgres.database.azure.com
   ```

This should resolve to the **private IP addresses** of the PostgreSQL servers.

### **Step 5: Configure PostgreSQL Replication (pglogical)**

Once the **Private Endpoints** and **Private DNS** are set up, you can proceed with setting up **pglogical** replication between the PostgreSQL servers using the private IPs.

#### **On the Publisher (East US 2)**:
1. Ensure `pglogical` is enabled:
   - Modify `postgresql.conf`:
     ```
     shared_preload_libraries = 'pglogical'
     wal_level = logical
     max_replication_slots = 4
     max_wal_senders = 4
     ```
   - Restart the PostgreSQL server.
   
2. Create the replication set:
   ```sql
   CREATE EXTENSION pglogical;
   SELECT pg_create_logical_replication_set('replication_set_name');
   ```

3. Add tables to the replication set:
   ```sql
   SELECT pg_logical.replication_set_add_table('replication_set_name', 'public.my_table');
   ```

4. Create a replication slot (if needed):
   ```sql
   SELECT pg_create_logical_replication_slot('my_slot', 'replication_set_name');
   ```

#### **On the Subscriber (West US 2)**:
1. Ensure `pglogical` is enabled similarly as on the publisher.
2. Create the subscription:
   ```sql
   SELECT pg_create_logical_replication_subscription(
       subscription_name := 'my_subscription',
       provider_dsn := 'host=<private_ip_of_publisher> dbname=<publisher_db> user=<username> password=<password>',
       replication_sets := ARRAY['replication_set_name']
   );
   ```

Make sure to replace `<private_ip_of_publisher>` with the correct private IP or DNS name of the PostgreSQL server in **East US 2**.

### **Summary of Steps**:
1. **Create Private Endpoints** for PostgreSQL Flexible Servers in both regions (**East US 2** and **West US 2**).
2. **Create a Private DNS Zone** (`privatelink.postgres.database.azure.com`), and link it to both VNets.
3. **Verify DNS Resolution** for both PostgreSQL servers via their private DNS entries.
4. **Configure pglogical replication** between the PostgreSQL servers using the **Private IPs** or **DNS names** of the Private Endpoints.

This setup ensures that your **PostgreSQL replication** works securely over **Azure’s internal backbone** network, with **Private Endpoints** offering stronger isolation and **DNS resolution** handling cross-region access.
