Create a Chroot Directory Structure:
First, you need to create a directory structure that will serve as the root for the chroot jail.

sudo mkdir -p /sftp
sudo mkdir -p /sftp/a/b/c

Set appropriate permissions on the directories. The user server1user should have write permissions to the /a/b/c directory.

sudo chown server1user:server1user /sftp/a/b/c
sudo chmod 755 /sftp/a/b/c

Create a group that will contain users allowed to use SFTP.
sudo groupadd sftp_users


Edit your SSH configuration file (/etc/ssh/sshd_config) and add the following lines at the 

Match User server2user
    ChrootDirectory /sftp
    ForceCommand internal-sftp
    AllowTcpForwarding no
    X11Forwarding no
    PermitTunnel no
    PasswordAuthentication yes
    AuthorizedKeysFile /etc/ssh/%u/authorized_keys

After saving the changes to sshd_config, restart the SSH service for the changes to take effect:

sudo systemctl restart sshd

Now, when server2user connects via SFTP to server1, they will be confined to the /a/b/c directory. Any attempt to navigate outside this directory will result in access denial.

Ensure to test thoroughly to make sure the setup works as expected before deploying it in a production environment. Additionally, make sure to back up your SSH configuration before making changes.
