resources:
  requests:
    memory: "2Gi"
    cpu: "500m"
  limits:
    memory: "2Gi"
    cpu: "500m"
This configuration means:

The container is guaranteed 2Gi of memory and 0.5 CPU core (requests).
The container is limited to 2Gi of memory and 0.5 CPU core (limits).
If the container uses more memory or CPU than the limit, Kubernetes may kill the container and try to restart it.
