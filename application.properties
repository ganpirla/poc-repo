Graceful Shutdown: Ensure your Spring Boot application handles graceful shutdown correctly. This means that the application should stop accepting new requests, finish processing in-flight requests, and only then shut down.
In Spring Boot, this can be done by setting the following in your application.properties or application.yml:

server.shutdown=graceful
spring.lifecycle.timeout-per-shutdown-phase=30s
This ensures the server waits for a certain period (in this case, 30 seconds) to complete existing requests before shutting down the pod.

You should also ensure that Kubernetes is configured for a graceful termination period, which gives the pod enough time to shut down gracefully before being forcibly terminated:

spec:
  terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 60
