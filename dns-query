Non-authoritative answer:
acs-mirror.azureedge.net	canonical name = acs-mirror.trafficmanager.net.
acs-mirror.trafficmanager.net	canonical name = acs-mirror.azureedge.net.edgesuite.net.
acs-mirror.azureedge.net.edgesuite.net	canonical name = a434.d.akamai.net.
Name:	a434.d.akamai.net

Name:	a434.d.akamai.net

It looks like you're showing the result of a DNS query, likely for the domain `acs-mirror.azureedge.net`. Let me break down the output for you:

- **Canonical names (CNAMEs)**:  
  The query reveals a chain of CNAME records, which are essentially aliases or redirects pointing to other domains:
  - `acs-mirror.azureedge.net` → `acs-mirror.trafficmanager.net`
  - `acs-mirror.trafficmanager.net` → `acs-mirror.azureedge.net.edgesuite.net`
  - `acs-mirror.azureedge.net.edgesuite.net` → `a434.d.akamai.net`

- **Final A-records**:  
  After following the chain of CNAMEs, the query resolves to two IP addresses for `a434.d.akamai.net`:
  - `173.223.162.89`
  - `173.223.162.104`

This likely represents the content delivery network (CDN) used by the service for faster content delivery (in this case, Akamai). Akamai is a global CDN provider, and the DNS query has resolved the domain to a specific set of IP addresses hosted on their network.

Is there something specific you want to know or troubleshoot about this DNS query?
