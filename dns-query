Non-authoritative answer:
acs-mirror.azureedge.net	canonical name = acs-mirror.trafficmanager.net.
acs-mirror.trafficmanager.net	canonical name = acs-mirror.azureedge.net.edgesuite.net.
acs-mirror.azureedge.net.edgesuite.net	canonical name = a434.d.akamai.net.
Name:	a434.d.akamai.net

It looks like you're showing the result of a DNS query, likely for the domain `acs-mirror.azureedge.net`. Let me break down the output for you:

- **Canonical names (CNAMEs)**:  
  The query reveals a chain of CNAME records, which are essentially aliases or redirects pointing to other domains:
  - `acs-mirror.azureedge.net` → `acs-mirror.trafficmanager.net`
  - `acs-mirror.trafficmanager.net` → `acs-mirror.azureedge.net.edgesuite.net`
  - `acs-mirror.azureedge.net.edgesuite.net` → `a434.d.akamai.net`

- **Final A-records**:  
  After following the chain of CNAMEs, the query resolves to two IP addresses for `a434.d.akamai.net`:
  - `173.223.162.89`
  - `173.223.162.104`

This likely represents the content delivery network (CDN) used by the service for faster content delivery (in this case, Akamai). Akamai is a global CDN provider, and the DNS query has resolved the domain to a specific set of IP addresses hosted on their network.

Is there something specific you want to know or troubleshoot about this DNS query?  


To download files, you generally do **not** need to worry about using the **final A record** or **CNAMEs** directly. Here's why:

1. **DNS Resolution**:  
   When you make a request to download a file (e.g., `acs-mirror.azureedge.net`), your computer or server will automatically resolve the domain name (like `acs-mirror.azureedge.net`) to an IP address using DNS. This means it will follow the chain of CNAME records to the final A record (IP address), and then it will connect to the server using that IP address.

2. **CNAMEs**:  
   CNAMEs (Canonical Name records) are just aliases, so if you provide `acs-mirror.azureedge.net`, DNS will resolve it for you to the correct final destination (the A record). You don’t need to manually handle or use CNAMEs when downloading; the DNS system automatically does that for you.

3. **Final A Records**:  
   The A records are the actual IP addresses where the content is hosted. These are the IPs your system will connect to after DNS resolution. When you access the domain, your browser or download tool will use the resolved IP address to reach the server, not necessarily the CNAME directly.

### Summary
- **Use the domain name** (`acs-mirror.azureedge.net`) for your download URL.
- Your system will automatically resolve this to the **A record** (IP address) through DNS.
- You **don’t need to manually use the CNAME or final A record** — the system does that for you when you initiate the download.

If you're downloading a file using a URL like `https://acs-mirror.azureedge.net/somefile.zip`, the DNS resolution happens in the background to resolve that domain to the right IP. You just need to use the domain, and the rest is handled automatically.

Does that clear things up? Or is there a specific issue you're running into?


If you need to **allow HTTPS traffic** in your network to the URL for file downloads, you should configure your firewall or network security device to allow traffic to the **base domain** (e.g., `acs-mirror.azureedge.net`) on port **443**, which is the standard port for HTTPS.

Here's how you can approach it:

### 1. **Allow the Base Domain (e.g., `acs-mirror.azureedge.net`)**
   You should allow traffic to the **fully qualified domain name (FQDN)**:  
   `acs-mirror.azureedge.net`

   - Since the domain will resolve to a dynamic set of IPs (due to the CDN nature, such as Akamai), you should allow the domain itself rather than a specific IP address.
   - The DNS will resolve to different IP addresses over time, depending on network conditions and load balancing, so restricting to IPs might not be reliable.

### 2. **Allow Port 443 (HTTPS)**
   - Ensure that your firewall allows outbound **HTTPS traffic** (port 443) to `acs-mirror.azureedge.net`.
   
### 3. **Optional: Allow Related Domains**
   If you want to be more thorough, you may also need to allow other domains in the CNAME chain. For example:
   - `acs-mirror.trafficmanager.net`
   - `acs-mirror.azureedge.net.edgesuite.net`
   - `a434.d.akamai.net`
   
   While these CNAMEs can point to different IPs, it’s usually more efficient to simply allow the base domain (`acs-mirror.azureedge.net`), as that will handle the redirection through DNS.

### 4. **DNS Resolution (Optional)**
   If your firewall can perform DNS filtering, you might configure it to specifically resolve and allow the domain name `acs-mirror.azureedge.net`. This way, the firewall will resolve the domain and ensure that the associated IP addresses are accessible.

### 5. **Considerations for CDN-based URLs**
   Since Akamai and Azure use CDNs, the actual IP addresses may change, and there may be regional differences in the IPs you are accessing. That’s why allowing the **domain** rather than specific IPs is a more reliable method.

### Practical Steps

1. **Allow DNS Resolution for `acs-mirror.azureedge.net`**:
   Ensure your network allows DNS resolution for `acs-mirror.azureedge.net`.

2. **Allow HTTPS (Port 443) for the Domain**:
   Configure your firewall to allow HTTPS (port 443) to `acs-mirror.azureedge.net` (and optionally related domains if needed).

3. **Test the Configuration**:
   After allowing the domain and port, test by attempting to download the file or access the URL. Make sure there are no issues with the connection.
